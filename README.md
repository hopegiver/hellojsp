# HelloJSP
HelloJSP is simple jsp framework.
You can build java web applications with only jsp.
It uses MyBatis for database handling and uses Velocity to output HTML.
If you want, you can do everything with just a text editor.
This is a framework that goes against the times.
But this will give you less stress and more freedom.
